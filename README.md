# Wanderlust
Your one-stop shop for information on the next city you want to visit! Wanderlust will help you plan your next vacation and learn about the best cities to visit in a particular country.

## Features
Some of Wanderlust's great features include;
- City Recommendations - When you click on a country to explore, the app generates and recommends three cities in that country based on their overall importance, population size, and popularity as a travel destination.

**NOTE: City Recommendations no longer work, due to the discontinuation of the Sygic API for student use.**

- :dollar: <-> :euro: Currency Conversion - Wanderlust helps travelers budget for their next vacation by showing how far their dollar will go using regularly updated exchange rates!
- Helpful Phrases - The app pre-populates some travel phrases in the destination's official language. Additionally, users are able to utilize the feature to translate their own words and phrases.
- :airplane: Book Flights - Through the Skyscanner widget, users can book flights to their destination with just a few clicks. The app tracks the user's current location to find the nearest airport and prefills the destination with the city they are exploring. 
- Recent Destinations - Wanderlust saves the most recent destinations that users have explored and displays links to those cities at the bottom of the Homepage. With one click, users can discover a new city or navigate back to one they already learned about.
