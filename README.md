- Currency Conversion - Wanderlust helps travelers budget for their next vacation by showing how far their dollar will go using regularly updated exchange rates!
- Helpful Phrases - The app pre-populates some travel phrases in the destination's official language. Additionally, users are able to utilize the feature to translate their own words and phrases.
- Book Flights - Through the Skyscanner widget, users can book flights to their destination with just a few clicks. The app tracks the users current location to find the nearest airport and prefills the destination with the city they are exploring. 
- Recent Destinations - Wanderlust saves the most recent destinations that users have explored and displays links to those cities at the bottom of the Homepage. With one click, users can discover a new city or navigate back to one they already learned about.
